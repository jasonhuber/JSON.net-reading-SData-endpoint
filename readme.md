Overview

*	This project should show you how to pull in an entity to an object, edit thata object and output a new object...
*	Right now it shows you how to add a new "field" to the JSON feed (total Exployees as an aggregation) and how to pull only those accounts starting with A.
*	This latter example can be done through an SData URL filter, but for demonstration purposes in code I left it.

Requires

*	JSON.net from Newtonsoft
*	working SData output of some sort.
	
Uses

*	I have used this to rewrite custom SData endpoints for filters on the dashboard of saleslogix using JavaScript.
